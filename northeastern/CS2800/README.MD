# CS2800 - Logic and Computation

## Class Website
I took this class in Spring 2014. The website for that semester has been removed, but they usually use the same URL scheme. The most recent I could find was: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs2800sp15/index.html

## Using this code
To run these scripts, you need to install the [ACL2s](http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/) package in Eclipse. This is a reasoning package built by the professors who taught this class.
